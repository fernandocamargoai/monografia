This paper has as a goal to propose a system of automatic reminders that makes use of a history of executions of tasks in order to try to find the best moment for a new planned goal to be executed. Such a system should help people to improve their productivity and avoid procrastination.

First, it introduces the concept of procrastination and shows how it's affecting the productivity of people. Then it proposes a tool for planning and execution of goals that should greatly enhance the productivity of its users. After that, an extension of that tool is proposed, which should create automatic reminders for new goals planned by its users, in order to try to predict the best time execute them based in previous executions of similar goals. Then, throughout this paper, this intelligent system that generates automatic reminders is implemented and tested.
