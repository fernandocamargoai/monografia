\begin{abstract}{Aid system to the achievement of goals through automatic reminders}
This paper presents a system of automatic reminders based on historical execution of tasks to define the best moments of execution for scheduled new goals, contributing to increase the productivity and combat procrastination. First, the concept of procrastination is inserted and its effect on personal productivity is assessed. Then it's proposed a tool for planning and executing of goals to greatly enhance the productivity of its users. The tool is then extended to send automatic reminders of scheduled new goals in order to predict the best time of execution based on the history of executions of similar goals. This intelligent system that generates automatic reminders is implemented and tested. In its implementation, we can highlight the use of the Sweep Line Algorithm, which plays an important role in the final solution.
